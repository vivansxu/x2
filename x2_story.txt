Once upon a time, there was a girl who was required to write a story. She really did not: know how to start. One day, she invited three friends to help her.
	 The first one is named Saleh, he added this sentence. In addition, he also added this one. Saleh then pushed to the story fo the other friends to help.

The second person is Candice, she is going to write two sentence. Vivian might wrote her story file name wrong. I don't know if this matter for this assignment.

The third person is Holiday, she is gonna write two beautiful sentence for vivian.Vivian is a good girl and she is so friendly to help Holiday fighre out some difficult problems.

Thanks for her friends, the girl finally finished her story. Group working is wonderful!
